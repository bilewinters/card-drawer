# card-drawer

It is 2020. And many people across the world cannot meet each other in person to play warhammer underworlds.

This little app is an experiment in making that a little easier, and a chance for me to have a little play with building an electron app in a few hours.

## Development

`yarn start`

## Building

`yarn && yarn package`

(This is designed to run on a mac, with `wine` installed.)
